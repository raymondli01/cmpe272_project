# Agentic Enterprise Software Platform ‚Äì Team Project Ideas (Fall 2025)

This semester focuses on building **enterprise systems with embedded autonomous agents** that can perceive, decide, and act. Below are four scoped project ideas designed for a team of four. Each balances feasibility with ambition, and touches on cloud, microservices, observability, QA, and security.

# Leading Project Idea

# A.W.A.R.E. - Agent for Water Autonomy, Resilience, and Efficiency

A proactive, self-healing AI agent for intelligent water utility management. This project is developed for the **CMPE-272: Enterprise Software Platforms** course at **San Jose State University (Fall 2025)**.

## 1\. The Problem

Municipal water networks are critical yet fragile infrastructures. They face constant threats from aging pipes, unexpected leaks, potential contamination, and massive energy consumption. Current management systems are almost entirely **reactive**, addressing failures only *after* they have caused significant water loss, service disruption, and potential public health risks.

## 2\. Our Solution: An Agentic Approach

A.W.A.R.E. is a proactive control system built on a **digital twin** of a municipal water network. It leverages a multi-agent AI to monitor the network in real-time, predict failures before they occur, and take autonomous actions to ensure the system remains resilient, safe, and efficient. It shifts the paradigm from reactive maintenance to **proactive, self-healing orchestration**.

## 3\. Key Features

  * üíß **Proactive Leak Pre-emption:** Analyzes acoustic and pressure data to detect and locate pipe fissures *before* they burst. Autonomously isolates compromised sections by controlling smart valves, minimizing water loss and preventing service outages.
  * ‚ö° **Dynamic Energy Optimization:** Forecasts water demand and monitors the real-time electricity price grid to shift energy-intensive operations (like filling reservoirs) to off-peak hours, drastically reducing operational costs.
  * üó∫Ô∏è **Real-time Network Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard provides human operators with a live, intuitive view of the entire network's health, the agent's actions, and key performance indicators.
  * üõë **Autonomous Visual Isolation:** When a leak is detected, the agent automatically updates the status of the pipe in the system, triggering a real-time visual change on the network dashboard.

# Other Project Ideas

## 1. Agentic Incident Response Platform
### Problem
Enterprises struggle with monitoring floods of observability data. Alerts are noisy and response is manual, slow, and inconsistent.

### Idea
Build a platform where **an autonomous incident-response agent** triages observability events, correlates them, and suggests or executes first-line remediation.

### Core Features
- **Microservice architecture** for observability ingestion, correlation, and notification.
- **Agentic decision-maker** that applies rules + ML models to classify alerts (critical, warning, noise).
- **Action module** that can auto-restart services or scale replicas when anomalies are detected.
- **Dashboard** with audit logs, allowing humans to approve/override decisions.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Observability ingestion + API.
- Service B: Decision agent with rule engine + ML.
- Service C: Action execution + cloud orchestration.
- Frontend/Dashboard: Visualization + override controls.

## 2. Agentic Campus Marketplace
### Problem
Marketplaces (student classifieds, campus services) are usually static. Buyers and sellers spend too much time negotiating, verifying, and filtering.

### Idea
Create a **campus marketplace** where embedded agents assist both buyers and sellers: negotiating prices, verifying item details, and flagging suspicious behavior.

### Core Features
- **User microservices** for authentication, listings, orders, chats.
- **Buyer/Seller negotiation agents** that suggest counter-offers or meeting times.
- **Fraud-detection agent** that flags listings based on heuristics + historical data.
- **Observability + security hooks** for monitoring abnormal activities.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Authentication + user roles (buyer, seller, admin).
- Service B: Listings + orders microservice.
- Service C: Negotiation + fraud detection agents.
- Frontend: Web dashboard for buyers, sellers, and admin.

## 3. Agentic QA-as-a-Service
### Problem
Enterprise QA is still human-driven, with brittle test suites that lag behind fast-moving microservices.

### Idea
Develop an **agent-driven QA service** that automatically generates, executes, and adapts test cases for microservices as APIs evolve.

### Core Features
- **Test agent** that reads API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger) and generates test cases.
- **Self-adapting**: When API schema changes, tests are updated automatically.
- **Result analyzer**: Agent prioritizes failures by business impact and files tickets.
- **CI/CD integration**: Auto-run in pipelines, expose results via API + dashboard.

### Division of Work
- Service A: API ingestion and schema diff.
- Service B: Test generation agent.
- Service C: Execution + result prioritization.
- Dashboard: QA results, trend analysis.

## 4. Agentic Compliance Auditor
### Problem
Regulatory and security compliance checks (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA) are usually manual audits that occur infrequently.

### Idea
Build a **compliance auditing platform with an autonomous compliance agent** that continuously scans system configurations, logs, and data pipelines.

### Core Features
- **Agentic compliance checker** that maps configs/logs to compliance rules (e.g., encryption, data retention).
- **Alert engine** that notifies admins of non-compliant patterns in real time.
- **Evidence collector** that auto-generates compliance reports.
- **Observability hooks** for visibility into compliance status over time.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Config/log ingestion.
- Service B: Compliance rule engine + agent.
- Service C: Alerting + reporting service.
- Frontend: Compliance dashboard with status badges.

# Project Selection Guidance
Each idea:
- Scales to a team of 4.
- Has at least one **agent** that perceives (input), decides (logic/ML), and acts (execution).
- Uses enterprise platform concepts: cloud deployment, microservices, observability, QA, and security.
- Yields a demonstrable product (dashboard + agent in action).
