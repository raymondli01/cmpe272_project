# Agentic Enterprise Software Platform – Team Project Ideas (Fall 2025)

This semester focuses on building **enterprise systems with embedded autonomous agents** that can perceive, decide, and act. Below are four scoped project ideas designed for a team of four. Each balances feasibility with ambition, and touches on cloud, microservices, observability, QA, and security.

---

## 1. Agentic Incident Response Platform
### Problem
Enterprises struggle with monitoring floods of observability data. Alerts are noisy and response is manual, slow, and inconsistent.

### Idea
Build a platform where **an autonomous incident-response agent** triages observability events, correlates them, and suggests or executes first-line remediation.

### Core Features
- **Microservice architecture** for observability ingestion, correlation, and notification.
- **Agentic decision-maker** that applies rules + ML models to classify alerts (critical, warning, noise).
- **Action module** that can auto-restart services or scale replicas when anomalies are detected.
- **Dashboard** with audit logs, allowing humans to approve/override decisions.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Observability ingestion + API.
- Service B: Decision agent with rule engine + ML.
- Service C: Action execution + cloud orchestration.
- Frontend/Dashboard: Visualization + override controls.

## 2. Agentic Campus Marketplace
### Problem
Marketplaces (student classifieds, campus services) are usually static. Buyers and sellers spend too much time negotiating, verifying, and filtering.

### Idea
Create a **campus marketplace** where embedded agents assist both buyers and sellers: negotiating prices, verifying item details, and flagging suspicious behavior.

### Core Features
- **User microservices** for authentication, listings, orders, chats.
- **Buyer/Seller negotiation agents** that suggest counter-offers or meeting times.
- **Fraud-detection agent** that flags listings based on heuristics + historical data.
- **Observability + security hooks** for monitoring abnormal activities.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Authentication + user roles (buyer, seller, admin).
- Service B: Listings + orders microservice.
- Service C: Negotiation + fraud detection agents.
- Frontend: Web dashboard for buyers, sellers, and admin.

## 3. Agentic QA-as-a-Service
### Problem
Enterprise QA is still human-driven, with brittle test suites that lag behind fast-moving microservices.

### Idea
Develop an **agent-driven QA service** that automatically generates, executes, and adapts test cases for microservices as APIs evolve.

### Core Features
- **Test agent** that reads API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger) and generates test cases.
- **Self-adapting**: When API schema changes, tests are updated automatically.
- **Result analyzer**: Agent prioritizes failures by business impact and files tickets.
- **CI/CD integration**: Auto-run in pipelines, expose results via API + dashboard.

### Division of Work
- Service A: API ingestion and schema diff.
- Service B: Test generation agent.
- Service C: Execution + result prioritization.
- Dashboard: QA results, trend analysis.

## 4. Agentic Compliance Auditor
### Problem
Regulatory and security compliance checks (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA) are usually manual audits that occur infrequently.

### Idea
Build a **compliance auditing platform with an autonomous compliance agent** that continuously scans system configurations, logs, and data pipelines.

### Core Features
- **Agentic compliance checker** that maps configs/logs to compliance rules (e.g., encryption, data retention).
- **Alert engine** that notifies admins of non-compliant patterns in real time.
- **Evidence collector** that auto-generates compliance reports.
- **Observability hooks** for visibility into compliance status over time.

### Division of Work
- Service A: Config/log ingestion.
- Service B: Compliance rule engine + agent.
- Service C: Alerting + reporting service.
- Frontend: Compliance dashboard with status badges.

# Project Selection Guidance
Each idea:
- Scales to a team of 4.
- Has at least one **agent** that perceives (input), decides (logic/ML), and acts (execution).
- Uses enterprise platform concepts: cloud deployment, microservices, observability, QA, and security.
- Yields a demonstrable product (dashboard + agent in action).

Choose the one that resonates most with your team’s interests and skill sets. The critical success criterion: **ship with at least one working agent by semester’s end.**
