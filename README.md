# Leading Project Idea

# A.W.A.R.E. - Agent for Water Autonomy, Resilience, and Efficiency

A proactive, self-healing AI agent for intelligent water utility management. This project is developed for the **CMPE-272: Enterprise Software Platforms** course at **San Jose State University (Fall 2025)**.

## 1\. The Problem

Municipal water networks are critical yet fragile infrastructures. They face constant threats from aging pipes, unexpected leaks, potential contamination, and massive energy consumption. Current management systems are almost entirely **reactive**, addressing failures only *after* they have caused significant water loss, service disruption, and potential public health risks.

## 2\. Our Solution: An Agentic Approach

A.W.A.R.E. is a proactive control system built on a **digital twin** of a municipal water network. It leverages a multi-agent AI to monitor the network in real-time, predict failures before they occur, and take autonomous actions to ensure the system remains resilient, safe, and efficient. It shifts the paradigm from reactive maintenance to **proactive, self-healing orchestration**.

## 3\. Key Features

  * üíß **Proactive Leak Pre-emption:** Analyzes acoustic and pressure data to detect and locate pipe fissures *before* they burst. Autonomously isolates compromised sections by controlling smart valves, minimizing water loss and preventing service outages.
  * ‚ö° **Dynamic Energy Optimization:** Forecasts water demand and monitors the real-time electricity price grid to shift energy-intensive operations (like filling reservoirs) to off-peak hours, drastically reducing operational costs.
  * üó∫Ô∏è **Real-time Network Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard provides human operators with a live, intuitive view of the entire network's health, the agent's actions, and key performance indicators.
  * üõë **Autonomous Visual Isolation:** When a leak is detected, the agent automatically updates the status of the pipe in the system, triggering a real-time visual change on the network dashboard.

# A.L.O. ‚Äì Agentic Logistics Optimizer
An autonomous logistics optimization agent for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This project is developed for the **CMPE-272: Enterprise Software Platforms** course at **San Jose State University (Fall 2025).**

---

## 1. The Problem
Modern supply chains operate under volatile conditions: fluctuating demand, constrained warehouse capacity, unpredictable fuel prices, and delivery bottlenecks. Existing ERP logistics modules rely on static optimization rules or manual oversight, resulting in inefficiencies, missed delivery windows, and inflated operational costs. Most systems remain **reactive**, recalculating routes and plans only after disruptions occur.

---

## 2. Our Solution: An Agentic Approach
**A.L.O.** introduces a **multi-agent decision framework** that continuously perceives logistics data across inventory, transportation, and fulfillment nodes. Each agent autonomously evaluates trade-offs between **delivery cost, warehouse proximity, carbon footprint, and timeliness**, dynamically reconfiguring logistics plans in real time. This shifts logistics management from **batch optimization** to **continuous, autonomous orchestration**.

---

## 3. Key Features

- **üõ∞Ô∏è Predictive Route Reconfiguration:** Continuously forecasts delivery risks (traffic, weather, vehicle health) and autonomously adjusts routing before disruptions occur, minimizing delays and cost overruns.  

- **üè≠ Adaptive Fulfillment Allocation:** Uses real-time inventory data to determine the optimal warehouse for each order based on proximity, processing load, and energy efficiency‚Äîreducing both shipping time and carbon impact.  

- **üì¶ Multi-Objective Trade-off Engine:** Applies reinforcement learning to balance competing KPIs such as cost, timeliness, and sustainability. Continuously refines its decision model through post-delivery feedback.  

- **üìä Digital Twin Dashboard:** Provides operators with a live visualization of the logistics network, including agent decisions, predicted risks, and what-if scenario simulations.  

- **‚öôÔ∏è Autonomous Exception Handling:** Detects disruptions (e.g., supplier delays, vehicle breakdowns) and executes mitigation actions‚Äîrerouting shipments, reassigning carriers, or dynamically adjusting inventory thresholds without human intervention.  

---

## 4. Expected Impact
A.L.O. transforms enterprise logistics from static optimization to **self-adaptive orchestration**, improving delivery reliability, reducing fuel and storage costs, and enabling sustainability-aware decision-making at scale.

# A.I.R. for ModelOps ‚Äì Agentic MLOps Incident Response Platform
An autonomous incident-response agent designed to maintain reliability and stability in AI/ML production systems. This project is developed for the **CMPE-272: Enterprise Software Platforms** course at **San Jose State University (Fall 2025).**

---

## 1. The Problem
Modern AI-driven organizations deploy hundreds of machine learning models into production. These models degrade over time due to **data drift**, **concept drift**, **pipeline errors**, or **infrastructure issues**. Existing MLOps tools detect issues but rarely respond autonomously-resulting in delayed remediation, inconsistent retraining workflows, and operational bottlenecks that slow down critical decision systems.

---

## 2. Our Solution: An Agentic Approach
**A.I.R. for ModelOps** introduces an **autonomous reliability agent** that continuously monitors deployed models and their supporting data pipelines. When it detects anomalies such as performance degradation, input data drift, or failed retraining; it autonomously triggers recovery actions like model rollback, data validation, or retraining orchestration. This system shifts AI operations from **reactive maintenance** to **self-healing model lifecycle management**.

---

## 3. Key Features

- **üìà Model Drift Detection:** Continuously tracks model accuracy, confidence scores, and feature distributions. When deviation exceeds thresholds, the agent flags drift events in real time.  

- **‚öôÔ∏è Autonomous Remediation:** Executes predefined playbooks‚Äîrolling back to a stable model, triggering retraining jobs, or isolating faulty data pipelines without human intervention.  

- **üß† Adaptive Learning Engine:** Uses feedback from past incidents to refine thresholds and improve drift classification accuracy, ensuring smarter interventions over time.  

- **üîó Data Pipeline Health Monitoring:** Monitors ingestion latency, schema consistency, and data freshness. Automatically restarts failed ETL jobs or reroutes ingestion paths.  

- **üìä Observability Dashboard:** Provides a unified view of model health, pipeline stability, drift events, and the agent‚Äôs automated actions, including audit logs and manual override controls.  

---

## 4. Expected Impact
A.I.R. for ModelOps enhances AI infrastructure reliability by enabling **autonomous model lifecycle management**. It minimizes downtime from data or model failures, reduces operational load on MLOps teams, and ensures consistent decision performance transforming AI systems from static deployments into **continuously self-correcting intelligent services**.

---

## 5. Target Industry
Ideal for organizations deploying machine learning at scale:
- **Financial Services:** Fraud detection and risk-scoring models.  
- **E-commerce:** Recommendation and pricing algorithms.  
- **Healthcare AI:** Predictive diagnostics and operational ML models.  
- **Autonomous Systems & IoT:** Edge-deployed AI requiring continuous adaptation.  
- **AI Platform Providers:** Companies building MLOps or AIOps platforms seeking autonomous reliability modules.
